				intially pushed me away. However, by pushing through the bad times I then found great times to
				eventually

			<p>My top three games all offer immersion with great settings of enjoyment. I found all three through
				interestingly from different public game festival I attended in the past. In terms of music, my top
				songs I
				found through spotify discover with the songs lyrics taking an emotional hold on me. As for movies, all
				my
				top choices i grew up watching but as I get older I praise the unique storytelling and the way they are
				filmed. They all have a charm to them that stays in memory.</p>

			<h3>Games Delights</h3>
			<ol>
				<p>
					<li>The Mass Effect trilogy, is my favorite, it initially was stale, but it ultimately paid off with
						its
						impactful choices and rewarding ending.</li>
					<li>Yu-Gi-Oh is my second favorite game; it offers enjoyable critical thinking with a stylistic
						approach
						to online duels.</li>
					<li>Smite is reasonably my third, mainly due to the game being the one I excel the most in
						performances
						wise.</li>

			<h3>My Preferred Music Exploration</h3>
			<ul>
				<p>
					<li><q>Faded to Black</q> by xxx Tentacion and Blink-182</li>
				<ul>
					This is my favorite emotionally invoked song that incorporates an older, previously unused sound
					track
					made before XXXTentacion's passing.
				</ul>
				<li><q>Rose Golden</q> by Kid Cudi</li>
				<ul>
					During the most challenging period of a demanding career, this song served as my best source of
					motivation everyday, helping me push forward consistently.
				</ul>
				<li><q>Radio Gaga</q> by Queen</li>
				<ul>
					The performance and message of was written too beautifully to not be a favorite.</p>
