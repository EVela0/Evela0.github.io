			<h2>What is DCeased</h2>
			<p>The storyline <b><dfn
						title="A play on the company name DC and word deceased meaning dead">DCeased</dfn></b> is a
				zombie what-if scenario comic run by <abbr title="Detective Comics">DC</abbr>. The series is
				strengthened with emphasis on using their <dfn
					title="a character who has little status or isn't popular">underdog</dfn> characters by immediately
				killing off fan-favorite characters like Superman and Batman. They changed the zombie virus instead into
				the <abbr title="Anti-Life Equation">ALE</abbr> which works, best explained by Batman as.</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Bruce_Wayne_(DCeased)/Quotes">
				<br><q>They're not zombies.</br> <br>They're not consumed by hunger.</br> <br>They're not feeding.</br>
					<br>They're spreading death.</br> <br>They're stealing life. These are the Anti-Living. And the
					trigger is an equation</q></br>

			<h2>How the story is written unique</h2>
			<p>My favorite chapter involves all the <q>villain</q> characters swapping their role dynamics. The main
				events have already occurred, meaning all the heroes are zombies. When the last hero dies, the story
				then switches the lead onto the <q>villains</q> who then grow into the new heroes of the story. The
				villains' interests lead them from protecting themselves to raising and protecting a group of orphans
				who are alone.</p>

			<h2>Analyzing Appeal</h2>
			<p>This became a <s>generic</s> unique take on how a zombie story unfolded. This was a trend that I believe
				<abbr title="Detective Comics">DC</abbr> did the best with, truly making an unpredictable pathing of the
				story. I would heavily reccomend the comic series <cite
					cite=https://www.dc.com/graphic-novels/dceased>DCeased</cite> to any <abbr
					title="Detective Comics">DC</abbr> fans or zombies enjoyers.
